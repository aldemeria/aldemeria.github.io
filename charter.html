            a. Individuals recognized as <span class="highlight" data-toggle="popover" data-content="'Titled' should probably be given an exact definition.">titled</span> by the Conclave of Aldemeria shall be considered members of the Conclave, absolutely equal under the law and among fellow members.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            b. Membership of the Conclave of Aldemeria may be conferred upon a non-member by way of a vote in support of conferral of membership of at least five votes from noble members of the Conclave, with each noble casting a single vote regardless of rank, in conjunction with a formal vote of approval from the sitting Minister of Applications. Individuals upon whom membership has been conferred shall be granted the title of Commoner unless explicitly ruled otherwise.

          <div class="subsection">
            c. Upon acceptance as a Commoner of the Conclave of Aldemeria, the Commoner is welcomed to Endelvalyia until the completion of the Liege offer process.

            d. If a noble member of the Conclave wishes to relinquish himself of a vassal commoner, he may do so by way of a formal posting to the Hall of Nations. The commoner is thus left landless and has 5 days to appeal or entertain other liege offers within the posting. If no lieges present offers or the commoner accepts none within the period, the commoner is no longer considered a member of the Conclave of Aldemeria. They may re-apply if they are not able to find a liege within 5 days.

          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>a. Definition of a County</h3>
            <p>
            A county is the most basic political division in the Conclave of Aldemeria. A county may be composed of a variety of settlements that can differ in size, composition, and number. The first county of a realm is expected to have at least one settlement containing a minimum of 25 buildings, as well as including 2 additional settlements each containing a minimum of 5 buildings. Particularly large structures may be used in place of a hamlet. Additional counties in a realm may differ in composition. These additional political divisions are required to contain a minimum of 35 buildings to meet the definition of a county. Together, these settlements must include forms of residential presence, several industries, economy, cultural development, secure infrastructure and connections to other locations as appropriate.
            <br/>
            The number of structures required may be more than 35, if any of the following are true:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The proposed county does not have at least three settlements.
              </li>
              <li>
                The proposed county is not the first county of a realm, and contains no settlements of at least 25 buildings.
              </li>
              <li>
                The average building size within the county is considered small.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>b. Definition of Titles</h3>
            <p>
            For the purposes of administration and governance, the Conclave of Aldemeria shall formally recognize the following international titles as applying to members of the Conclave, in order of greatest to least authority:
            <br/>
            Emperor / Empress
            <br/>
            King / Queen
            <br/>
            Prince / Princess
            <br/>
            Duke / Duchess
            <br/>
            Count / Countess
            <br/>
            Lord / Lady
            <br/>
            <span class="highlight" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The title 'Esquire' doesn't properly describe what this role is and a change should be considered.">Esquire</span>
            <br/>
            Commoner
            </p>
            <p>
            Holders of each and every title shall be equal under the law and among their peers as members of Aldemeria; members holding the rank of Lord or Lady upwards shall be additionally recognized as noble and shall hold additional abilities including the right to vote, claim land, serve on a Conclave jury, and run for elected office.
            <br/><br/>
            I. While these titles alone may be recognized in Conclave law, this Conclave shall make no attempt to standardize rank and title structures internationally, and shall expressly encourage the cultivation of local naming conventions.
            <br/><br/>
            II. In cases where one citizen resides in a realm controlled by a higher ranking individual, they are considered to be a vassal, and the higher ranking member is their liege. The highest power in each realm is considered to be the liege of every other member of their realm, with everyone else being their vassals, but other liege vassal relationships may exist within realms as well. I.e. a Prince could have a Duke, who has a Count, who may be considered the vassal of both the Prince and Duke, or just the Prince, subject to the discretion of the highest authority of the realm.
            <br/><br/>
            III. All non-noble members of the Conclave (Commoner and Esquire) must reside in a realm under the jurisdiction of a liege that is noble (Lord or Higher). Upon reaching the rank of Lord, they may elect to claim land under the land claim laws and start their own realm, or remain within the same realm if they wish. Vassals also reserve the right to change lieges as long as the new liege is willing to accept them as a vassal.

          <h2 class="content-subhead"><span class="highlight" data-toggle="popover" data-content="This section is VERY wordy and repetitive. We should look at ways to shorten it without losing any substance.">IV. Title Ascension</span></h2>
          <div class="subsection">
            a. A member of the Conclave may be ascended in title under either of two circumstances; either the member resides under the jurisdiction of a noble liege, in which case the ascension shall take place at the full discretion of the liege, or the member resides independently, under the jurisdiction of the Conclave Assembly, in which case the ascension shall be at the full discretion of the Conclave Assembly and shall be enacted with a greater than 50% vote in support of a motion for ascension. Members of the realm going for ascension who possess votes within the conclave shall not be counted for the ascension in any way. Ascension requests are open for two weeks for applications towards Duke and lower. Ascension requests are open for four weeks for applications towards Prince and above. After this time, applications are considered to have failed. Applicants may re-apply at any time. Within the context of Ascension Applications, abstained votes count as no votes.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            b. If a vassal within a realm is promoted to the rank of Lord/Lady or higher, a formal notice must be provided to the Conclave by the Liege, at this time, if any noble member of the conclave deems the promotion premature, they have the right to call for a vote against the ascension, this vote must reach a total of greater than 50% of the active votes in the <span class="highlight" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The term council here does not make sense and needs to be fixed.">council</span>, following all standard voting procedures and activity laws.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            c. The following requirements for ascension of independent realms are not to be followed strictly to the letter. Rather, they are meant to be guidelines of what the Conclave deems proper for a member of that rank. Ultimately, it is up to the discretion of the Conclave as to whether the member is deserving of such a rank, given that the member in question can reasonably justify deficiencies in any of the following statements. The same is expected of lieges promoting a vassal; while keeping to the international standard is expressly encouraged, the liege has express power over internal ascensions.

            Wars are restricted to combat between realms at war and military infrastructure belonging to those realms.
            Combat and/or destruction that spreads to individuals and realms not involved in the war may be viewed by the Conclave of Aldemeria as violations against the Conclave itself, and as such are treated as international war crimes and may be prosecuted.

          <div class="subsection">
            b. Declaring War
            The highest authority of a realm may declare war legally for any reason by openly declaring war in the Court of Arbitration. A full 24 hours must pass prior to the commencement of hostilities, unless both parties publicly agree to an earlier time. Either realm involved in a legal war may elicit support, however, supporting realms must declare their intention to join the war in the post notifying the Conclave of the Declaration of War. Only the highest authority in a realm may declare the support for their entire realm. Lesser nobles may declare their support.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            c. Death and/or Surrender
            Individuals at war who decease during the war from any cause, either natural or in combat, are considered to have perished in lore and may not engage in further hostilities. Disputed deaths may be confirmed through an inspection of server logs.
            Individuals at war who wish to surrender may do so through a public notice of surrender to the Court of Arbitration.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            d. Conclusion of a Legal War
            A legal war is considered to have come to its conclusion when one of the following occurs:
            <ul>
              <li>The highest authority of either the attacking or defending realm deceases.</li>
              <li>The highest authority of either the attacking or defending realm surrenders publicly through the Court of Arbitration.</li>
              <li>The highest authority of either the attacking or defending realm has not appeared in game or engaged in war for 3 days. The individual whose activity falls under this situation will be considered to have lost the war. External circumstances may nullify this if notified in the Court of Arbitration.</li>
              <li>The highest authority of both the attacking and defending realms sign a formal declaration of peace in the Court of Arbitration.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            e. War Demands
            A legal war typically will have some kind of demand. The following demands are considered legal:
            <ul>
              <li>Prevention of land claims and annexation of land. Annexation of land may only occur when the two realms are close neighbors.</li>
              <li>Demanding payment for damaged goods, property, or honor. Failing to follow through with a trade agreement falls under this.</li>
              <li>Other demands may be considered legal by the standing Justice Minister if requested in the Court of Arbitration</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            f. Materials of Great Destruction
            Buckets of Lava, TNT, and Fire as generated by a Fire Charge or Flint and Steel are legally recognized as Materials of Great Destruction, items which when used are capable of causing great amounts of destruction over a large area. These materials may be used in legal war during combat so long as the use of these is constrained to the immediate area of combat. The offensive and/or destructive use of these materials in areas outside of legal military conflict may be recognized as a war crime. The destruction of settlements, defensive structures, and other areas is not an acceptable use of these materials during a legally declared war.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            g. War Crimes
            Individuals or realms found to have committed actions during the duration of a legally declared war that violate either the Conclave Rules of War or the Conclave Criminal Code may find their actions investigated by a War Crimes Tribunal. A War Crimes Tribunal may take place after the formal cessation of hostilities at the discretion of the Justice Minister.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            h. Lore War/Battle
            A 'Lore War' is a type of legal war or battle that may be declared between individuals or realms who have previously agreed on a time and place to engage in battle for mutual enjoyment. Prior to the commencement of hostilities, all parties may agree to terms to be adhered to during combat; as contained events, Lore Wars shall not be governed by the terms of the Conclave Rules of War. Individuals found to have committed actions during the duration of a lore war that violate the agreed-upon terms may be held liable through a civil trial if necessary.

          <div class="subsection">
            a. Any voting member of the Conclave of Aldemeria can declare themselves voluntarily inactive at any time in an official post, from the time they declare themselves such their votes will not be considered for any voting majority thresholds. At anytime after declaring themselves inactive, they may regain activity be simply declaring themselves active again in an official post, from which point their votes shall once again be counted towards voting majority thresholds.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            b. Any voting member of the Conclave of Aldemeria who has not <span class="highlight" data-toggle="popover" data-content="What specifically this means is open to interpretation and should be clarified.">actively participated on the forums or on the server for a period of two weeks</span>, shall be declared involuntarily inactive, from which point their vote shall not be counted towards voting threshold majorities. To regain activity, the member must simply re-state their activity in an official post on the forums
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            c. Any voting member of the Conclave who is not seen <span class="highlight" data-toggle="popover" data-content="What specifically this means is open to interpretation and should be clarified.">within the lands of Aldemeria (server presence) and does not participate in Conclave governance (legal discussion/voting on the forum) for a period of six months </span>or more shall be considered a 'Non-Participating Member of the Conclave of Aldemeria.' From this time, they lose their votes within the Conclave and will not be considered for voting thresholds. Non-Participating Members of the Conclave of Aldemeria will still be recognized as part of the Conclave, as will the votes of any members of that realm who remain active.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            d. Any Non-Participating Member of the Conclave of Aldemeria who is not seen within the lands of Aldemeria (server presence) and does not participate in Conclave governance (legal discussion/voting on the forum) for an additional period of six months or more shall be considered a 'Withdrawn Member of the Conclave of Aldemeria' and have abdicated their throne. A Non-Participating Member of the Conclave of Aldemeria is considered to still be inactive regardless of any activity if they do not successfully restore their right to vote first.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            e. Having abdicated their throne, their realm is open to claims from vassals still living within the realm: the highest ranking vassal of the realm from this time shall serve as the liege/ruler of the realm. Should there be two vassals of the same rank, the realm may be split between them. The new ruling house(s) may not include the builds of the former ruling house for their own rank progression. Additionally, should no vassals claim the realm for their own, foreign realms that directly border (via land) the abdicated realm may claim the realm as a 'vassal state.' This 'vassal state' cannot be integrated with the new suzerain realm. New rulers may not build in the finished counties of the former realm, with the exception of improving infrastructure. Improvements made to finished areas of the vassal realm may not be considered for rank advancement. Empty areas of the vassalized realm may be annexed directly to the suzerain realm.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            f. To restore their status as a full member of the Conclave, the Non-Participating or Withdrawn Member must create a post declaring their return to activity affirming their dedication to the Conclave, once they feel they have proven their intention to return to activity. A vote of the Conclave requiring a clear majority (greater than 50% of the active votes of the Conclave) must be passed to show the community believes that the abdicated member intends to become active again. Non-Participating Members are returned their privilege to vote. Withdrawn Members are returned to their position as the ruler of the lands containing their former builds, as well as their right to vote.
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            g. Should a Withdrawn Member successfully earn the right to vote and the right to rule their lands again, they will not be able to recover areas outside of the counties where they personally built, i.e. areas of their realm they did not build in, areas vassals constructed, and areas that were claimed by not built in may not be kept by default. Should disagreements result, and an agreement cannot be made between the involved parties, the land dispute may proceed to a trial or to a war.
